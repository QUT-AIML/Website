  "description": "Project Night is where ideas evolve into real-world projects. The evening starts with a lightning talk covering the AI Hype Cycle (Gartner Curve) and embedding Google’s Gemini into apps and workflows. Afterwards, dive into hands-on building: work on projects at any level, team up, share knowledge, and grow your AI/ML skills. Build exciting projects like Pokémon Identification or Action Recognition. Bring your laptop, curiosity, and energy – let’s create something awesome together!",
