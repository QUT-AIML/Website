  "description": "Project Night is where ideas evolve into real-world projects. The evening starts with a lightning talk covering the latest in AI, including: Gemini Diffusion (AI-generated visuals and smart tools), AlphaEvolve (AI-driven digital evolution), and Nano Banana (compact high-performance AI hardware). Afterwards, dive into hands-on building: work on projects at any level, team up, share knowledge, grow your AI/ML skills, and build exciting projects from simple models like Pokémon Identification to advanced AI tools like Action Recognition. Bring your laptop, curiosity, and energy – let’s make something awesome together!",
