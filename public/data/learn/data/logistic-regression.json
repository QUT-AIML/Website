    "definition": "Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.",
    "types": [
      "Binary Logistic Regression: Predicts one of two possible outcomes.",
      "Multinomial Logistic Regression: Predicts outcomes with more than two categories."
    ],
    "key_concepts": [
      "Sigmoid Function: Maps any real-valued number into the range [0,1] for probability interpretation.",
      "Log-Odds: Linear combination of input features transformed into probabilities via the sigmoid function.",
      "Decision Boundary: Threshold (commonly 0.5) used to classify outcomes.",
      "Loss Function: Uses cross-entropy (log loss) to evaluate model performance.",
      "Assumptions: Linear relationship between features and log-odds, independent errors, no multicollinearity."
