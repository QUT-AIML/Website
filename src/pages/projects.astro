				The QUT AI & ML Society runs collaborative projects that bring students, researchers, and industry partners together to build practical AI and machine‑learning solutions. 
        Projects range from developer tools and data‑driven apps to research prototypes and everyday innovations, with clear roles for contributors at every skill level. 
        We pair hands‑on work with mentorship, workshops, and hackathons to help members learn, share code, and grow their portfolios while applying AI responsibly. 
        Join to contribute, learn from peers, and help shape projects that make a real impact.
