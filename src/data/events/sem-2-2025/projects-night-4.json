  "description": "Project Night is where ideas turn into progress. We start with a quick lightning talk covering the latest AI news and tips, including how to use Google Colab for your projects, then dive straight into hands-on building. Work on beginner, intermediate, or advanced projects, team up, share skills, and support each other. Learn by doing and grow your confidence. Build cool things from simple models to advanced AI tools. No long workshops, no lectures—just a short kick-off and then pure project time. Bring your laptop, your curiosity, and your energy and let’s make something awesome together!",
