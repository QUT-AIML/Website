  "description": "Need a space to focus, catch up on assignments, or just take a break with friends? Study Night is a relaxed, no-pressure evening designed for getting things done in good company. Enjoy a chilled environment with lo-fi beats, bring your own work – assessments, revision, side projects – and connect with peers while you work. Bring your laptop, your focus (or your procrastination energy), and settle in for a productive yet social night.",
