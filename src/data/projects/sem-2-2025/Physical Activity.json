    "longDescription": "This project uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to classify physical activities from sensor data, including cycling, jogging, football, and jump rope. The dataset includes multiple CSV files, and users can explore distance metrics, feature scaling, and optimal K selection to enhance classification results."
