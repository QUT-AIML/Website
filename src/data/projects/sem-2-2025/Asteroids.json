    "longDescription": "This project uses logistic regression to classify asteroids based on their orbital and physical characteristics. The dataset is split into chunks due to its large size (~435MB, 958,525 rows), and requires reassembly using provided scripts. Users can explore binary classification, model evaluation, and feature importance techniques."
