    "longDescription": "This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Users can explore convolutional layers, pooling layers, data augmentation, dropout, and model evaluation techniques. The project is ready for training and experimentation with different CNN architectures."
