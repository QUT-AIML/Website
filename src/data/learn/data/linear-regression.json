    "definition": "Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.",
    "types": [
      "Simple Linear Regression: Models relationship between one feature and the target.",
      "Multiple Linear Regression: Models relationship between two or more features and the target."
    ],
    "key_concepts": [
      "Coefficient: Measures the impact of a feature on the target.",
      "Intercept: Value of the target when all features are zero.",
      "R² (R-squared): Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target.",
      "Residuals: Differences between predicted and actual values.",
      "Assumptions: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of errors."

  "tips": [
    "Always visualize data to check linearity before applying regression.",
    "Avoid multicollinearity; highly correlated features can distort coefficients.",
    "Check residuals to validate assumptions.",
    "Use feature scaling if your model includes variables with very different ranges."
