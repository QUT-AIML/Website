    "definition": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.",
    "types": [
      "Sequential CNNs: Layers are stacked sequentially for simple architectures.",
      "Functional API CNNs: Allows building complex architectures with multiple inputs/outputs.",
      "Subclassed CNNs: Custom models by subclassing the Model class in frameworks like TensorFlow."
    ],
    "key_concepts": [
      "Convolutional Layers: Extract features using filters (kernels).",
      "Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and computation while retaining important features.",
      "Fully Connected Layers: Combine extracted features to perform classification or regression.",
      "Activation Functions: Non-linear transformations like ReLU applied to feature maps.",
      "Overfitting Prevention: Use dropout, data augmentation, and regularization."
