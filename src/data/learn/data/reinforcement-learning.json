    "definition": "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.",
    "types": [
      "Value-Based Methods: Learn the value of actions (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).",
      "Policy-Based Methods: Learn a policy directly to choose actions (e.g., Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic).",
      "Model-Based Methods: Learn a model of the environment to plan actions."
    ],
    "key_concepts": [
      "Agent: Learner or decision maker.",
      "Environment: The system the agent interacts with.",
      "Action: A choice made by the agent.",
      "State: Current situation of the agent in the environment.",
      "Reward: Feedback received after taking an action.",
      "Policy: Strategy that the agent follows to decide actions.",
      "Value Function: Expected cumulative reward from a state or state-action pair.",
      "Exploration vs Exploitation: Trade-off between trying new actions and leveraging known rewards."

    "Start with simple environments (e.g., OpenAI Gym CartPole) before moving to complex tasks.",
    "Balance exploration and exploitation to ensure effective learning.",
    "Use reward shaping carefully to guide the agent without biasing undesirably.",
    "Monitor training with evaluation metrics and visualization of rewards over time.",
    "Consider using function approximation (like neural networks) for large state spaces."
