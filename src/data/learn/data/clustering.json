    "definition": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their features, without predefined labels.",
    "types": [
      "K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into k clusters using centroids.",
      "Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters using agglomerative or divisive methods.",
